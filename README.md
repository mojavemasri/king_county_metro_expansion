# Metro Stop Optimization Project

## Overview
This project aims to optimize the locations of metro stops in the Eastern King County metro area using a simulated annealing algorithm. By strategically placing metro stops, we seek to improve the efficiency and accessibility of public transportation in the region.

## Methods Utilized
### Simulated Annealing Algorithm
Simulated annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It iteratively explores the solution space, allowing for movement towards better solutions while occasionally accepting worse solutions to escape local optima.

### Data Collection
Data on population density, traffic patterns, existing metro routes, and key destinations were collected to inform the optimization process. Geographic Information System (GIS) tools were utilized to preprocess and visualize the data.

### Objective Function
The objective function was designed to balance several factors, including minimizing travel time for commuters, maximizing coverage of densely populated areas, and ensuring connectivity to important landmarks and institutions.

## Limitations
### Data Quality
The accuracy and completeness of the input data can significantly influence the effectiveness of the optimization process. Efforts were made to use the most reliable data sources available; however, inaccuracies or biases in the data may impact the results.

### Simplifying Assumptions
Certain simplifications and assumptions were made to facilitate the optimization process, such as uniform travel times and homogeneous population distributions. These simplifications may not fully capture the complexities of real-world transportation systems.

### Computational Complexity
Optimizing metro stop locations for a large geographic area involves a combinatorial optimization problem with a vast solution space. While simulated annealing offers an efficient approach, the computational resources required can be significant, especially for fine-grained optimizations.

## Future Endeavors
### Fine-Tuning Parameters
Further experimentation with the simulated annealing algorithm, including adjusting temperature schedules and neighborhood exploration strategies, could potentially improve the quality of the solutions obtained.

### Incorporating Real-Time Data
Integration of real-time data on traffic patterns, rider demand, and other dynamic factors could enhance the responsiveness and adaptability of the metro system to changing conditions.

### Stakeholder Engagement
Engaging with local communities, transportation authorities, and urban planners will be crucial for ensuring that the optimized metro system meets the needs and preferences of the diverse stakeholders in the Eastern King County area.
